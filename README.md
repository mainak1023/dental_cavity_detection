# Dental Cavity Detection

A machine learning project for detecting dental cavities in images using deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This project implements a dental cavity detection system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It can classify dental images into different categories, such as normal teeth, teeth with cavities, and other dental conditions.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and augmentation for dental images
- Multiple model architectures (custom CNN, transfer learning with MobileNetV2, ResNet50, VGG16)
- Model training, evaluation, and fine-tuning
- Visualization tools for model performance and predictions
- Interactive web interface for real-time predictions
- Command-line interface for batch processing
